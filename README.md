**RocketLaunches**


An analysis of the history of space exploration. 

The python script was used to extract, structure and analyse the data. 

The data was sourced from public satellite and launch catelogs and most of it was in an outdated format .fwf(Fixed Width Format).

I used Excel to initilly import the data as csv. All further transformation and analysis was done using Python.

The charts and final infographic were created using excel and pictochart.
